I adjusted the number of items to be a random integer between 1-20 to replicate a typical shopping experience. I adjusted the shopping time based on the number of items picked. It seems logical that the more items someone picks up, 
the more time they would spend shopping / in the store. I also edited the checkout time in a similar way. If the number of items was 15+, it took the checker
2 minutes to ring up all the items. I adjusted customer arrival to be 1 customer per minute. I wanted to do more with this and make it more dynamic,
I just could not figure out how to create a function where there would be a busy period and a slow period, and the customersarrived would change based upon
that. The number of checkers play the biggest role on the waitTime and idleTime. The more checkers, the more idle time, and the less customers still
waiting to be checked out after 180 minutes.
